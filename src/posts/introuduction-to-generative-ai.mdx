Have you ever stucked with numerous Tutorial videos be it from youtube, udemy or any other learning platform without ever building some meaningfull project? Have you always felt confident after finishing project then after somedays forgot all of your learning then started learning again? 

You are in Tutorial Hell..

In this blog i will explain you how to escape from this Tutorial hell.

## What is Tutorial Hell?

**Tutorial hell** is a common term in programming education for being stuck in an endless loop of following tutorials without independently applying the knowledge to build your own projects. It describes writing code only when an instructor shows you how, but struggling to start from a blank slate or solve novel problems on your own.
So its means that you are stucked in endless loop of tutorial videos.

## How to escape from Tutorial Hell?

At some point of coding journey I was also stuck in Tutorial Hell. But i came out of this build many awesome projects. I will tell you step by step how you can also do these

## Step 1: Stop watching tutorials ! And start Building!

Yes, its just that simple! You should first stop watching those videos. But wait? You may be wondering if you stop watching videos how can you learn to write code, right? Don't worry thats the process of learning code. First start building any thing you like . While building you will generally face difficulties or problems. All you need is search that problems and solve this. Thus you will learn far better way by building and debugging.

## Step 2:Take Help from AI tools

Many people will disagree about using ai tools while learning. But I am totally positive about AI tools. But, there is a catch! Many beginner are doing this mistakes that they are prompting everyting from start to end. If you do this you are never goint to learn code(real code not vibe coding). Instead, you should only take help from ai tools when you got errors or you struggle understanding some concepts. Ai tools is ovbioulsy faster and time efficient in that case. An ofcourse , this tools can generate and explain of any concepts that you face difficult to understands. And lastly, for some repative coding you can can use ai to become time efficient.

## Step 3: Read Documentation 

You need to read Documentation guys. Initially it will look too much overwhelming. But do not try to read Documentation all at once. That is not correct way of doing this. Instead, while building projects when you face problems you should search that only portions from Documentation thats it.

Lets give you an example - assume that i am using Tailwind in my project. Now i forget how to add shadow to a div. So what I do is that searh 'shadow Tailwind' in google or Tailwind main documentation. It will show me how to add this. That's it. You don't really need to memorize all syntaxes. 

Now if still could not understand from documentation you can ask ai to simplify it and explain that.
